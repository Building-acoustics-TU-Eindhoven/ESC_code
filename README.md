This work introduces a frequency-dependent Equivalent Scattering Coefficient (ESC) to quantify the room average degree of scattering per mean-free path resulting from sound wave interactions with objects, elements, and impedance discontinuities. These ESCs can be effectively applied in various hybrid room acoustic models, offering significant potential for high-frequency sound field reconstruction with limited computational resources.

Check "ESCandHybridModel.mlx" for the code to extract ESCs and a hybrid model to reconstruct the sound field.
Check "ESCandPWDanalysis.mlx" for the code to analyze Plane Wave Density function of the reconstructed sound field.
